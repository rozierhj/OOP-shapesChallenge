    Enter command: node index.js into the terminal. The application will ask the user for text to put on the logo and will test that the user input is 3 characters long. The application will ask the user for a color for the text and test that they give a valid color name or hexidecimal code. The application will give the user 3 options for a shape for the logo (Triangle, Square and Circle). The application will ask the user for a color for the shape background and will test that the user provides a valid color input.
